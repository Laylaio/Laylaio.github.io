				<h2>1. Spend two minutes with the experience and list all of your actions in granular detail.</h2>
				<p>I first browsed this part of the propaganda column on the homepage. When I clicked on one of the pictures of the exhibition, 
					I jumped to a new page, introduced the exhibition about The Picasso Century, and provided a map very thoughtfully, 
					The way of buying tickets, as well as the conversion between Chinese and English, is very international and thoughtful design, 
					including also providing a dining area. The design of the navigation bar also interests me. There are eight sections in total, 
					including the purchase of tickets, the understanding of the story behind the art, and the purchase of artworks. I think it is very convenient. 
					The two-minute experience made me feel The convenience and visual enjoyment brought to me by the NGV website.</p>
				
				<h2>2. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h2>	
				<p>When I was browsing the NGV website, the first thing I paid attention to was the layout design. 
					For example, I wanted to see the content, pictures or text about the exhibition first. 
					The designer took this into consideration. When I opened the website , I can see the pictures of the museum's publicity,
					the introduction of the artist, I think this is very important, a website needs to highlight a key point to attract consumers.</p>
				<h2>3. What did you spend the most time engaging with?</h2>
				<p>I spend the most time on virtual tours, this is an option to experience the NGV exhibition online, 
				   the 3d online exhibition provides many options, I can choose one of them according to my preferences, 
				   including some people who cannot come due to travel restrictions NGV, 
				   you can also choose to watch the exhibition online and buy some peripheral products, which is very convenient in my opinion.</p>

				<h2>4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h2>
				<p>In the two-minute interactive experience, what I often do is to click every button on the navigation bar. 
					In each area of these eight sections, I want to know what the main content of this section is displayed. 
					Another aspect is that the website also has A search option, I often look for the exhibition I am looking for or the art peripheral products I want to buy in the search bar.</p>

				<h2>5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h2>
				<p>The interactive website I expected is just like the NGV website. I pay great attention to the layout design of the website, 
					including the navigation bar and whether there is a search option. I think these three are very important to me, and they are also my expectations. 
					The website you want to see.</p>

				<h2>6. How does the experience communicate it's primary goal?</h2>
				<p>I think the most important goal of interactive experience communication is the theme. First, 
					we need to determine a theme and a general direction. For example, the website of the Victoria Art Museum, 
					the general direction of this website is to make a theme about the art museum. 
					The content of the website is Related to art, and to promote art, the purpose of art museums is to promote art knowledge, various exhibits, and national culture.</p>

				<h2>7. What is your impression of the intended length of a single interaction and how often you are intended to interact with the experience?</h2>
				<p>I think it depends on what functional area to preview, this time I chose the Victoria Art Gallery website, 
				   I think 2 minutes is enough for me, I have enough time to understand what is displayed in each section of the website. 
				   But if I'm going to preview this feature section of the store, I think I'll need more than 2 minutes, maybe 10 minutes, 
				   or more, because I need to look at the price of each item and find my favorite products.</p>

				<h2>8. What metaphor or metaphors does the experience's mental model reference?</h2>
				<p> I think the website of the museum is more like an organization. 
					It brings together various types of artworks and displays them to people all over the world. 
					It's like an orderly division of labor. Connect, which artwork is displayed on each panel.
					In an abstract way, this is the feeling this website brought me during the epidemic is more like a ray of sunshine, 
					especially since I can also watch the exhibition online
				    The 2 artworks that appear on my website are also based on the NGV exhibition, 
					which was once displayed at NGV. The background picture is the KAWA exhibition at the Victoria Art Gallery. 
					The website I designed is just like this kaws artwork. Concise and functional, just like kaws dolls, it conveys a pure picture.</p>

				<h2>9.  What does this reference suggest about how you should feel and/or act when engaging with it?</h2>
				<p>When I was experiencing the website of the Victoria Art Gallery, 
				   I found it interesting and functional. The interesting thing is that it provides users with a variety of exhibition choices,
				   including graphic introductions and 3D virtual browsing. It depends on which way of browsing each person prefers, 
				   it's very inclusive. In terms of functionality, the website also shows a very strong side, it is more like an organization, 
				   when you have browsed an exhibition and are interested in going to see it, it will provide the option of buying tickets, 
				   and these only need to be in It can be solved in one website, very organized.</p>

				<h2>10. What is the most frustrating element of the interaction and what makes it frustrating to you?</h2>
				<p>I think everything looks good, but if I have to say what frustrates me, personally, 
				   I like more interaction design, like when I click a button there is a sound,
				   or some animation in the background , or exhibit more videos about the artist.</p>

				<h2>11. What is the most satisfying element of the interaction and what makes it satisfying to you?</h2>
				<p>What I am most satisfied with is that this website provides an online 3D virtual browsing function.
				   I think this is really great. The 3D scene is very realistic, just like the feeling of offline experience, 
				   and I can watch various types of The art exhibition, I think this is very convenient.</p>

<!-- About Assignment 1 my design inspiration came from when I was drawing a few days ago, 
	I used a transparent drawing board to draw, and then I applied this idea to my website design, 
	I wanted to highlight the content of the background image , I used a light gray for the base color, 
	and a bright yellow for the title for contrast. I designed the navigation bar to the left of the website.
	When the button of week2 is clicked, it will jump to the corresponding area.-->
